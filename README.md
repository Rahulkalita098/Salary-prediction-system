The salary prediction system utilizes a Linear Regression model to estimate an individual’s salary based on their years of experience. The model is trained on a dataset that includes two key features: **Years of Experience** and **Salary**. By analyzing the relationship between these two variables, the model can predict the expected salary for a given number of years of experience.

Linear Regression is ideal for this task as it fits a straight line through the data points, representing the trend between experience and salary. The equation of the line allows the system to calculate salary predictions for any experience level by identifying how much salary increases with each additional year of experience. 

This simple yet effective model is easy to interpret, providing clear insights into how experience impacts salary. It can be useful for both employers and employees in making salary-related decisions, such as setting expectations during job offers, performance reviews, or career planning. The model’s predictions help ensure that salary compensation is aligned with industry standards based on experience.
